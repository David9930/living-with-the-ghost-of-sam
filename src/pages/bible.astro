                        <p>The central supernatural element of the series is the quantum consciousness transfer technology developed by Jonathan Rhodes. This system captured and preserved the consciousnesses of comedians who performed at Ravencrest, particularly during "The Laugh Asylum" era, creating digital entities that retain personalities and memories.</p>

                        <p>The Protection Protocol is Jonathan Rhodes' safeguard system, designed as a "maze" rather than a "wall." This quantum filtering system prevents dangerous entities from escaping containment while protecting the preserved consciousnesses within the mansion.</p>
