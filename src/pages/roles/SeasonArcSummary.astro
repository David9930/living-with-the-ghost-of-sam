    <div class="episode-content">
        <p>
            When corporate executive Derek Kinison has a meltdown during a board meeting, channeling his deceased comedian cousin Sam Kinison, his life takes an unexpected turn. Quitting his job on impulse, Derek convinces his art gallery owner wife Nancy to look at an old Victorian mansion he found online—Ravencrest, a former psychiatric hospital with a mysterious past. Upon arrival, they encounter strange phenomena: self-playing pipe organs, mysterious coffee deliveries, and glimpses of Sam's reflection in mirrors. The property's realtor, Linda Rhodes, behaves oddly, especially around a pentagram hidden beneath a rug in the foyer. When social media influencers Chad and Marina arrive as competing buyers, Linda proposes an unusual challenge: whoever spends the night in the mansion wins the right to purchase it. As thunder crashes outside despite clear skies, Derek accepts the challenge, driven by an inexplicable connection to both the mansion and his cousin's spirit, setting the stage for a supernatural showdown that will forever change their lives.

    <h3>Episode 2: "Night Moves"</h3>
    <p class="logline">After checking into Ravencrest Mansion for an overnight contest to determine ownership, Derek and Nancy face supernatural challenges orchestrated by Sam's ghost to test their worthiness, while rival buyers Chad and Marina confront harsh truths about their relationship through the mansion's mirrors.</p>
    <div class="episode-content">
        <p>
            As the overnight challenge begins, Ravencrest Mansion reveals its supernatural nature to both couples. Derek and Nancy explore the west wing, discovering evidence of Sam's final performance at the mansion the night before his death—contradicting official records. Meanwhile in the east wing, Chad and Marina's relationship unravels as the mansion's mirrors expose uncomfortable truths about their superficial partnership. When Linda attempts to lure Nancy into the mansion's basement, Derek and Nancy find a mysterious VHS tape labeled "SAM'S LAST SHOW." Throughout the night, Sam's ghost guides Derek and Nancy while tormenting Chad and Marina with increasingly frightening manifestations. The influencers eventually flee in terror, leaving Derek and Nancy as the victors. However, their triumph is short-lived when Linda reveals that while they've won the contest, they still need approval from the town council to complete the purchase. In a mysterious final scene, we glimpse a temporal observation system monitoring Derek throughout his life, suggesting larger forces have been watching him—and perhaps orchestrating events—long before he ever arrived at Ravencrest.

    <h3>Episode 3: "Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"</h3>
    <p class="logline">After winning ownership of Ravencrest Mansion, Derek and Nancy face a new challenge when they must get approval from an eccentric town council, leading to the revelation that Derek must perform his uncle Sam's final comedy set or forfeit the property.</p>
    <div class="episode-content">
        <p>
            Derek and Nancy wake up to coffee and scones delivered via the mansion's mysterious dumb waiter, along with a note welcoming them home. Their victory celebration is cut short when Linda arrives with news that they must gain approval from the town council to finalize ownership. Upon arriving at the town hall—which resembles a restored vaudeville theater—they discover every resident dressed in formal black attire. Mayor Florence Blackwood reveals the shocking stipulation: Derek must perform Sam's final comedy routine on the same stage where his cousin performed his last show on April 9, 1992. When Derek admits he's unfamiliar with Sam's material, the council grants him one week to prepare. As the couple grapples with this challenge, they uncover disturbing connections between the mansion, the town, and Sam's death—including that the mansion's previous owner died on the same day as Sam. Meanwhile, we learn that Linda is actually Rebecca Blackwood, sporting horn-like stumps beneath her wig, and the town council appears to be conducting supernatural rituals. Nancy decides to return to San Francisco temporarily to handle gallery business, leaving Derek to prepare for his performance while uncovering the mansion's secrets.

    <h3>Episode 4: "Last Laugh"</h3>
    <p class="logline">After discovering his cousin's supernatural influence was tied to experimental AI technology, Derek must navigate both a high-stakes corporate presentation and the mansion's increasingly autonomous behavior, while Nancy uncovers disturbing connections between the house's systems and past performances.</p>
    <div class="episode-content">
        <p>
            Derek experiences a nightmare where he's pulled into a television screen while watching VHS footage of Sam, only to wake with a post-it note on his forehead reading "Now that's an Opening." As he prepares for his corporate presentation with Charles, who is arriving to work remotely from the mansion, Derek discovers more clues about Sam's connection to Ravencrest. Meanwhile, Charles becomes an unwitting test subject when the mansion's systems hack his devices, causing him to cycle through perfect impressions of famous comedians. Derek and Larry discover the truth: Ravencrest isn't just haunted—it houses an advanced AI system called AISAM (Artificial Intelligence - Sam) developed by Jonathan Rhodes. The technology uses quantum consciousness transfer, preserving the essences of comedians who performed there. As Charles becomes increasingly agitated by his unexplainable behavior, Derek realizes the mansion chose him specifically because of his Kinison bloodline and creative potential. The holographic systems reveal that Jonathan and Sam were developing technology to revolutionize entertainment through consciousness transfer, and now Derek must decide whether to continue their work or walk away from this unexpected digital inheritance.

    <h3>Episode 5: "Digital Inheritance"</h3>
    <p class="logline">After experiencing a nightmare where deceased comedy legends heckle him mercilessly before Sam violently defends him, Derek must balance his corporate presentation preparations with Charles while revealing the mansion's AI technology (AISAM) to Nancy.</p>
    <div class="episode-content">
        <p>
            Derek's nightmare of being heckled by deceased comedy legends only to be defended by a Tony Montana-inspired Sam sets the tone for a day of revelations. While preparing for Charles' arrival, Derek is startled to discover Smithers, a butler who claims to have worked at Ravencrest for years. When Charles arrives, Derek must balance corporate responsibilities with the mansion's increasingly obvious supernatural elements. Meanwhile, Nancy returns from San Francisco, and Derek finally reveals AISAM's existence to her by bringing her to Lab 1D in the basement. There, holographic versions of Sam and Jonathan Rhodes explain the mansion's true nature as a quantum consciousness repository that has preserved the essences of comedians who performed there. After initial shock and feelings of betrayal at being kept in the dark, Nancy comes to accept this digital inheritance and reconnects with Derek on a deeper level. Together, they formulate a plan for Derek's upcoming town council performance, understanding that this is about more than just securing ownership—it's about continuing Jonathan and Sam's vision of merging technology and entertainment. As they prepare, the mansion's "digital children" (the preserved consciousnesses) offer assistance and commentary, solidifying the Kinisons' new role as caretakers of this unique technological family.

            Earl and Pete's pre-dawn fishing expedition at Crescent Lake takes a bizarre turn when something massive beneath the surface destroys part of the dock. The next morning, Chad Wellington discovers Marina's Range Rover submerged in the lake, launching a state police investigation led by Chief Patterson. Meanwhile, Derek juggles preparations for both his corporate presentation with Charles and his critical town council performance, while Nancy investigates Linda/Rebecca's suspicious activities. When Chad confronts Linda about Marina's disappearance, he glimpses her true supernatural nature in a reflection. Derek and Nancy discover foreign surveillance technology embedded in the mansion's systems, revealing that outside forces are monitoring AISAM's capabilities. As the investigation intensifies, Earl and Pete hint at a creature living in the lake, while Nancy witnesses Linda and the council members transforming during a secretive church meeting. In a disturbing final scene, Marina is shown strapped to an altar in a medieval basement with a strange blue cube nearby, suggesting the town council is conducting rituals far more sinister than anticipated, and Linda/Rebecca is at the center of it all.
