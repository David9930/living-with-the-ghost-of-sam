        <p>
            When corporate executive Derek Kinison has a meltdown during a board meeting, channeling his deceased comedian cousin Sam Kinison, his life takes an unexpected turn. Quitting his job on impulse, Derek convinces his art gallery owner wife Nancy to look at an old Victorian mansion he found online—Ravencrest, a former psychiatric hospital with a mysterious past. Upon arrival, they encounter strange phenomena: self-playing pipe organs, mysterious coffee deliveries, and glimpses of Sam's reflection in mirrors. The property's realtor, Linda Rhodes, behaves oddly, especially around a pentagram hidden beneath a rug in the foyer. When social media influencers Chad and Marina arrive as competing buyers, Linda proposes an unusual challenge: whoever spends the night in the mansion wins the right to purchase it. As thunder crashes outside despite clear skies, Derek accepts the challenge, driven by an inexplicable connection to both the mansion and his cousin's spirit, setting the stage for a supernatural showdown that will forever change their lives.

    <h3>Episode 2: "Night Moves"</h3>
    <p class="logline">After checking into Ravencrest Mansion for an overnight contest to determine ownership, Derek and Nancy face supernatural challenges orchestrated by Sam's ghost to test their worthiness, while rival buyers Chad and Marina confront harsh truths about their relationship through the mansion's mirrors.</p>
    <div class="episode-content">
        <p>
            As the overnight challenge begins, Ravencrest Mansion reveals its supernatural nature to both couples. Derek and Nancy explore the west wing, discovering evidence of Sam's final performance at the mansion the night before his death—contradicting official records. Meanwhile in the east wing, Chad and Marina's relationship unravels as the mansion's mirrors expose uncomfortable truths about their superficial partnership. When Linda attempts to lure Nancy into the mansion's basement, Derek and Nancy find a mysterious VHS tape labeled "SAM'S LAST SHOW." Throughout the night, Sam's ghost guides Derek and Nancy while tormenting Chad and Marina with increasingly frightening manifestations. The influencers eventually flee in terror, leaving Derek and Nancy as the victors. However, their triumph is short-lived when Linda reveals that while they've won the contest, they still need approval from the town council to complete the purchase. In a mysterious final scene, we glimpse a temporal observation system monitoring Derek throughout his life, suggesting larger forces have been watching him—and perhaps orchestrating events—long before he ever arrived at Ravencrest.
